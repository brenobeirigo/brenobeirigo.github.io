# Introduction

- Use strong verbs ("to be" is boring)
  - Don't turn verbs into nouns
  - Don't bury the main verb (verb close to the subject near the start of the sentence)
  - Data are, datum is
  - Affect = verb and effect = noun (generally)
  - Compare to = similiraties between different things, Compare with = to point out differences between similar things

  - Increasing power to separate:
    - Comma
    - Colon
      - Introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification (last clause sets up the next).
    - Dash
      - Add emphasis or insert an abrupt definition/description.
      - Use only when a more common mark of punctuation is anedequate.
    - Parentheses
      - Insert afterthought of explanation.
      - Not essential.
    - Semicolon
      - Connect two independent clauses (subject + predicate).
      - Separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation.
    - Period

  - Increasing formality:
    - Dash*** 17:38
    - Parentheses
    - The others

  - The rule of three's (lists, examples). When it is arbitrary, default to three examples.

# Parellelism

Make the choice for the structure and stick with it.
- Pairs of ideas joined by  "and", "or", or "but" should be written in parallel form. E.g.:
  - SVX but/and/or SVX
  - Infinitive phrase but/and/or Infinitive phrase
- Lists of ideas should be written in parallel form.

# Paragraphs

- Should be short (readers appreciate white spaces).
- 1 paragraph = 1 idea.
- Give away the punchline early:
  - WRONG: details, details, data, conclusion.
  - RIGHT: take-home message (similar to topic sentence), supporting ideas.
- Paragraph flow:
  - logical flow of ideas:
    - Sequential in time (avoid bizarre time lines);
    - General to specific (take-home, general point, specific elements);
    - Logical arguments (`if a then b;a;therefore b`).
  - parallel sentence structures;
  - *if necessary*, transition words (crutch for underlying faulty logic).
    - No fancy transitions (e.g., on the other hand, nevertheless), use "AND" (tacking on additional information) and "BUT" (changing gears).
- Make the last sentence memorable (readers remember first and last sentence best).
- Boil each sentence down to its *upshot* (the final or eventual outcome or conclusion) and organize/edit the paragraph.
- Repetition:
  - Is the second instance of the word even necessary?
  - If the word is necessary, is a synomym really better than just repeating the word?
  - For consistency, repeat key words (e.g., names of comparison, groups, variables); it is clearer for readers.
  - [Elegant variation](https://www.bartleby.com/116/302.html) = *disastrous variation* in scientific writing: the reader thinks you are talking about something else.

## Acronyms and Initialisms

- Acronym = read as a word (e.g., NASA).
- Initialism = read each letter (e.g., CPU).
- Resist the temptation to abbreviate words because they occur frequently.
- Use only standard; readers are burdened.
- Remember readers don't typically read start to finish; if you must use acronyms:
  - Define them separately in the abstract, each table/figure, and the text.
  - For long papers, redefine occasionally.
