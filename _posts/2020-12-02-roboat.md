In TRiLOGy, we will have two main uses cases: logistics and mobility.  
For both of the cases we need to make a decision to specify the cases along the following dimensions:  
* Users of the service  
* Network, part of Amsterdam to focus on  
* The infrastructure and the interaction with the autonomous/electric vessels    
* Type of decisions in volved and the associated time horizon 
* Data needed and whether it is available 
* Dynamic and/or stochastic elements to be included  

Possible application areas are assessed for their innovative character and added value for the city and its inhabitants. 

# Rotterdam

* Collaboration between Watertaxi Rotterdam and Flying Fish fits seamlessly into the ambition of the [Rotterdam Maritime Capital of Europe (RMCoE)](https://www.rotterdammaritimecapital.com/) network; Deploying digitisation with the aim of an efficient, sustainable and safe maritime sector[[ref](https://www.nieuwsbladtransport.nl/brandstories/2020/06/03/razendsnelle-digitale-ontwikkelingen-watertaxis/)].

* [Watertaxi Rotterdam](https://www.watertaxirotterdam.nl/) relies on a demand-dependent transport network of more than fifty private mooring places which are serviced by twenty boats.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rotterdam_docks.jpg" alt="rotterdam water taxi docks" width="500"/>

# Amsterdam canals

* Maximum legal speed on the city’s canals, which tends to be about 6 kph [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].

* One typical summer day (August 12, 2017), 502 vessels (boats, ferries, cargo ships) cruised along the 100 km canals and their 1,200 bridges (see [visualization](http://senseable.mit.edu/roboat_summer_day/)).
 
* 17 million tourists visit Amsterdam every year (300,000 come on cruise ships).

* Canals encompass
more than 100 km of waterways
and over 1,500 bridges. More than
1,500 historic buildings are located alongside such iconic canals like the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, effectively anchoring the cultural gravitas of the city and rightfully earning them a place for the canals in UNESCO World
Heritage Site list (source: [senseable city guide](http://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/20170525_SCL_Guide_Amsterdam-Roboat.pdf)).

* Constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century to transport carts, people, and horses. Now, thousands of trucks drive through Amsterdam every day for the supply of shops and restaurants, the collection of waste and the supply of building materials [ref](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/).

* The total of some 200 kilometres of quays and all those bridges are subsiding and weakening rapidly [ref](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/).

# Roboat

The Roboat is a barge-like, multi-purpose USV that is being developed to collect waste and transport construction materials in the centre of Amsterdam [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].
The novel robotic boat is easy to manufacture, highly maneuverable, and capable of accurate trajectory tracking in both indoor and outdoor environments [[ref](https://www.ams-institute.org/urban-challenges/smart-urban-mobility/roboat/)].
Current tests consists of way-point finding, autonomously docking and undocking, and obstacle avoidance. Features:

* The full-scale boat measures 2 by 4 meters. “These relatively small dimensions make the boat well suited for the urban environment,” says Carlo Ratti, Director of MIT Senseable City Lab and Principal Investigator in the project.

* The 12 kW battery currently provides 9-hours of non-stop operating time which enables the possibilities for various use cases.

# Zoev City

[Zoev City](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/) stands for *Zorgeloze Oplossing Elektrisch Vervoer*, or, a seamless electric city transport solution. 

* Developed the first officially certified electric tug/push boat. It transports building materials to various building projects in the city centre.

* Plan: fifteen hubs in the city where transport ships can load and unload - from where cargo continues by electric trolleys.

* Assets: electric tug/pusher and over thirty floating city hubs, some of which are covered in the dimensions 14 x 3.5 m and 20 x 4.25 m. In the coming period we will be investing heavily in the transport of goods, building materials and waste by water.


* GOAL: Develop a logistics system that can accommodate multiple shipping companies, such that the city can be supplied with building materials and/or other types of goods. For example, supplies to private individuals, shops, and other companies can travel by water and waste will be taken back with them.

* CONCEPT: Trucks unload goods at a warehouse outside the city and all goods are distributed to the final destinations via other city hubs. Loading and unloading locations are small city hubs spread throughout the city The intention is to increase the number of city hubs to promote urban distribution by water. Due to the use of small electric vehicles, Zoev City has in many cases the opportunity to also supply outside window times.

* Association of inner-city water transporters has been set up: VATGA - Association of Amsterdam Water Transporters of Goods and Waste.

# Use case description

In the following, a detailed description of each use case.


## Waste collection<a name="waste_fixed"></a>

 Almost 23 million kilos of household waste alone is produced in Amsterdam’s city centre each year; that’s aside from any commercial, industrial or green waste [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].

Roboat units can collect waste for the Centrum district of Amsterdam, where residents currently deposit trash on the curb for collection. To alleviate the many problems caused by large trash trucks on historic streets - congestion, pollution, noise, etc. - Roboat can serve as floating dumpsters that autonomously transfer waste.

Beyond Amsterdam, the proposed fleet of waste-collecting vehicles has the potential to provide infrastructural improvements in other water-based cities, where the need for a nimble waste collection system is even more dire.

<img src="http://senseable.mit.edu:60080/uploads/eb3cdb3342824ef1b24fc796e0dca016.jpg" alt="waste" width="500"/>

### Why?

**1) Avoid damage to fragile Amsterdam quay walls**

*Problem:* Waste is transported mainly by heavy, diesel-powered trucks on congested city roads, which not only worsen traffic and pollution but can damage quay walls and pavements, causing further disruption, safety risks, and costing taxpayers’ money to fix [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].
Kilometres of quay walls in the city are in poor condition due to years of neglect (e.g.,  [Quay wall Grimburgwal in the City of Amsterdam collapsed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amsterdam-institute-for-advanced-metropolitan-solutions/videos/native/urn:li:ugcPost:6706588026425888770/?isInternal=true&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Acompanies_company_videos_index%3BVkmIVbHMSyyinIqJ81OjNA%3D%3D), [sinkhole Marnixstraat](https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/174805/tramverkeer-plat-door-sinkhole-aan-marnixstraat)).

*Solution:* The Roboat is being developed for a range of uses, with autonomous waste collection being touted strongly as an alternative to road-based refuse handling.

**2) Decrease traffic**

*Problem:* The city center of Amsterdam is relatively small but busy.

*Solution:* As 25% of the city of Amsterdam consists of water surface, Amsterdam offers the ideal environment to expand its current infrastructure with the deployment of autonomous vessels, alleviating pressure from the streets.
Amsterdam is ideally suited to moving waste collection off its road network and onto its canals.
For example, by using Roboat to collect waste from Amsterdam’s city center, the number of traffic movements within the city center can be reduced. 

**3) Improve waste separation**

*Problem:* The current paradigm requires that residents take different types of trash to distinct locations, the inconvenience and complexity frequently result in lower recovery rates for recyclables and environmentally harmful waste. In response, Amsterdam is keen on significantly improving waste separation rates by 2020 [[ref](https://www.ams-institute.org/urban-challenges/smart-urban-mobility/roboat/)].

*Solution:* Roboat offers enormous possibilities in terms of environmental exploration and sensing. Roboats could also clear the canals from waste. The floating dumpsters can play a key role in source separation when other types of waste are added to the equation.

**4) Decrease visual pollution**

*Problem:* waste is currently placed at the curbs of the canals, distorting the view on the canals, taking up a lot of space and attracting rodents.

*Solution:* For the scenic views on the Amsterdam canals Roboat offers a more attractive way of collecting household waste.

* By placing the containers in the water, Roboat offers an alternative to the current built-in underground containers used throughout the city, which are unsuitable to be placed within the fragile quays of the canals. 
* Assuming that residents are willing to walk a maximum of 110 meters to dispose of household waste – the average distance Amsterdammers need to walk in other neighborhoods to bring their waste to the underground containers – approximately 48 floating containers need to be deployed in the canals to offer sufficient capacity.
* When the containers are full, a Roboat tug boat navigating autonomously will take the floating containers to the waste processing platform. With one vessel, the household waste of about 1100 households can be collected in a flexible and quiet way, without taking up space on the street.

### Questions on the status-quo

* What is the route of the trucks?
* What is the cost of the current system (trucks, labor, maintenance, quay wall reparations, etc.)?
* Are there areas only accessible by trucks? Where can Roboats successfully replace trucks?
* *"Our research shows that such a system could serve 70% of the Centrum district."* How to calculate this number?

### Current research

* [An Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search for Real-Time Waste Collection Inventory Routing with Autonomous Vessels *T. Gast, B. Atasoy, F. Duarte, D. Rus*](http://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/20200903_Gast-etal_WasteHotelRoboat_hEart.pdf) - Considers waste generated by hotels.
Investigates different waste generating scenarios and multiple re-optimisation strategies. Future research:
    * Heterogeneous set of containers with different sizes, to reduce the number of late picks.
    * Smarter, more complex operators can be investigated to enable the ALNS converge to a better solution.
    * Stochastic version.

* [Waste Collection in Amsterdam Centrum Using Autonomous Vessels: Optimization of container type selection and location for household waste collection in Amsterdam Centrum with Autonomous Vessels (Roboats) *H.J. van Toor*](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:8d5e0ef2-63d1-42ea-a69e-1f8fc89f4b10/datastream/OBJ/download) - Considers a facility location problem with different facility types in order to maximize the coverage with a minimum number of containers.
    * Comparison: (1) Roboats,trucks, and EVs Vs. (2) Roboats and EVs.
        * EVs take filled containers to a barge which can carry multiple EcoCassetes.
        * Roboats take filled containers to a barge.
        * Trucks lift underground containers.
        * Barge sails to the AEB (Waste Energy Company).

    * Recommendations:
        * Assigning a few households to a specific container with a slightly larger walking distance than 150 meters, it could save some extra located containers.

## Waste collection 2 - Floating depots<a name="waste_floating"></a>

Roboats move full containers to larger ships, where waste is unloaded.
In this setting, Roboats do not need to travel large distances to unload containers, which can be immediately cleaned and returned to quay walls.

**Questions**

* What is the size of the waste ships?
* How long does it take to unload a container?
* How many ships and roboats?
* What is the best route for Roboats and waste ships?
* What is the improvement over the fixed waste depot setup?

## Modular Roboats<a name="modular"></a>

Roboat has a unique modular design. The vessel consists of a hull, which forms the boat's technical basis, designed with different top decks that can be applied for multiple use cases: transportation of people and garbage collection, as well as stages and bridges when latched together.

According to each commodity's demand distribution, Roboat fleets can go to service points where autonomous hulls are outfitted to service people, freight, garbage, etc.

**Questions**
* How long does it take to change top decks?
* Where are the service points where Roboats are outfitted?
* Could top decks be crowdsourced?
* What is the capacity and top-deck assortment of each service point?
* How to match top-deck assortment with different demand distributions?

## MoD + Routing touristic tours<a name="tourist"></a>

Roboat can be used as an alternative mode of transport to get to museums in Amsterdam.
By strategically combining museum visits and boat tours, we propose an innovative approach using Roboat to improve the museum experience in Amsterdam.

**Questions**
* How many visitors per day (how to measure their movements)?
* To what extent Roboats can alleviate on-street traffic?
* What about the ongoing boat tours?
* Where are the pickup points (fixed, dynamic places)?
* Which destinations to include in the route?
* How to create personalized tours?
* How long boats wait at a point before departing (stochastic information)?
* Which points were already visited by each user (predict future destinations)?

## Edge interface<a name="interface"></a>

A key question for the Roboat project is how to interface between the canals and streets of Amsterdam. The solutions should be flexible and adaptive for different contexts. We propose three design solutions for different use cases. The first looks to extend the canal edge as a public space with a series of platforms. The second takes a more conventional route with a dynamic platform attached with a stair. The third allows for flexible docking with an extendable ladder.

## Passenger transportation<a name="passenger"></a>

Roboats can be autonomous water taxis or buses, adding to the experience of both tourists and locals.

<img src="http://senseable.mit.edu:60080/uploads/ad158d068d464caeb0d3e4a44bb2fd41.jpg" alt="mobility" width="500"/>


### Research

1. [Urban Water Mobility:
Reducing travel time within urban areas with watertaxi networks. *T.J. van Berkel*](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:8d15f145-3c7e-45c7-86df-0f2dd102e5b9/datastream/OBJ/download).
    

    **RQ:** What is a generic method to find the relationship between the number ofplaced jetties for watertaxis and the passenger travel time within an urban area?

    * Data (Rotterdam)
        * Coordinates of 79 Jetty nodes (Flying Fish);
        * Coordinates of 75 city nodes 
        * Sailing times (jetty x jetty) based on the max. speed of three travel zones (Flying Fish);
        * Walking time (city node x jetty node) from Google API.
        * Public transport (city node x city node) from Google API.
    

**Research assignments**


* *On-demand transportation:* Where does it make sense to use Roboats in comparison with other modes (see [time comparison](http://senseable.mit.edu/timing-amsterdam/))? Is it feasible to include Roboats in MaaS? What happens when there is no docking space (e.g., walls are busy, railings)?

## MoD + Transfers <a name="transfer"></a>

Roboats can transfer passengers to one another to improve operational efficiency.
Transfer operations may be carried out:
 
1. *Over water:* Roboats latch to each other and passengers move.    
1. *At fixed transfer points:* Roboat A delivers passengers at a fixed trasnfer point (jetty, quay wall) where they will be picked up by Roboat B.
1. *At temporary platforms:* Floating platforms are assembled on-demand to facilitate transfers between Roboats.
When individual Roboat units are latched, different combinations of floating platforms can be created.
In their new configuration they form floating pixels and respond as new autonomous organisms.

**Questions**

1. *Over water*   
    * How long does it take to latch Roboats and transfer passengers?
    * Where (i.e., which part of the route) do Roboats realize the transfer?
1. *At fixed transfer points*
    * Where are the transfer points?
    * How many transfer points are necessary?
1. *At temporary platforms*
    * How many platforms?
    * Where are they located?

## Mooring private boats<a name="mooring"></a>

Roboats can tug private boats, allowing individuals to moor their boats outside the city and summon them on demand.

**Questions**
* What is the demand?
* Can Roboats stop anywhere?
* Does rebalancing Roboats improve service levels?
* Is there a central Roboat depot?
* Where are the mooring locations?

## Delivery (sidekick drones)<a name="drones"></a>

Similarly to [truck+drone delivery](https://discovery.rsm.nl/articles/344-the-benefits-of-combining-drones-and-trucks-for-deliveries/), Roboats can work as movable depots centers from where drones pick up parcels.
This setup is the waterway-equivalent to Amazon's drone deployment blimp concept (see below).

[![Amazon Blimp](http://img.youtube.com/vi/BXY3LPx8DGc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY3LPx8DGc "Amazon drone-deploying blimp")

**Questions**
    
* How frequently Roboats visit fullfilmeent centers (hubs)?
* How to manage the battery usage of Roboats and drones?
* How to route Roboats and drones?

## Temporary infrastructure

Roboat units can join together to create temporary bridges, alleviating congestion on Amsterdam’s centuries-old bridges and canal-side streets. As an autonomous system, Roboat can respond in real time to the ebb and flow of rush hour traffic. Individual units can also tessellate to form floating stages and public squares on the canals, enhancing Amsterdam’s strong tradition of water-based events with a 21st-century technology.

## Food delivery<a name="floating"></a>

Roboat units can form floating food markets or become pop-ups stalls that appear on the canal’s edge for Amsterdammers to collect crates of fresh produce.
We imagine this use of autonomous boats could promote healthier food and create new public spaces for Amsterdam.
Roboat activates the canals while tapping into the resources located on the pervasive regional network of waterways.

[<< Back to summary](#summary)

***

**Drawbacks**

The use cases for food distribution and temporary floating markets for IJburg and the Havenstad area, of which the latter has yet to be developed, show insufficient potential because of Amsterdam’s rich supermarket density. On average, Amsterdammers only have to travel 400 meters to the nearest supermarket for good access to healthy and affordable food [[ref](https://www.ams-institute.org/news/roboat-ahoy-first-prototypes-autonomous-boats-tested-amsterdam/)].

## RoundAround<a name="round"></a>

Could a fleet of autonomous boats shorten distances between Amsterdam's newest innovation center and a major tourist attraction while at the same time showcasing cutting-edge science, design, and technology? This is what we propose with roundAround, a dynamic circular bridge composed of Roboats.

## Construction logistics<a name="construction"><a/>

More than thirty percent of all traffic in Amsterdam is construction-related.
According to "Amsterdam Vaart", a coalition of the municipality of Amsterdam, Port of Amsterdam, TNO and Waternet, to which ORAM is affiliated, there is a lot of potential to have a large part of construction logistics run over water and thus keep the city more accessible.
Only the last mile remains via the road, from the mooring place to the construction site when the capacity on the road permits [[ref]](https://www.zoevcity.nl/de-kracht-van-de-gracht-stadsdistributie-en-bouwlogistiek-over-het-water/).

Amsterdam Vaart! has already achieved a reduction of 10,000 inner-city road kilometers and a considerable CO<sup>2</sup> reduction [[ref]](https://www.ams-institute.org/events/ama-smart-mobility-festival/).
