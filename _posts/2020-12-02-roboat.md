In TRiLOGy, we will have two main uses cases: logistics and mobility.  
For both of the cases we need to make a decision to specify the cases along the following dimensions:  
* Status quo
* Objective
* Users of the service  
* Network, part of Amsterdam to focus on  
* The infrastructure and the interaction with the autonomous/electric vessels    
* Type of decisions in volved and the associated time horizon 
* Data needed and whether it is available 
* Dynamic and/or stochastic elements to be included  

Possible application areas are assessed for their innovative character and added value for the city and its inhabitants.

# Use case description

In the following, a detailed description of each use case.

## Logistics - Waste collection<a name="waste_fixed"></a>


For logistics it was evident that waste collection is a prominent area to investigate.
Nevertheless, there are still things to be decided on even if it is waste collection.

* *Status quo:* What are the main drawbacks of the current solution? How to measure these drawbacks' impact (e.g., the influence of garbage trucks on traffic/quay walls, visual pollution)?

* *Objective:* min. cost (operation, deployment), min. travelled distance, min. congestion on the roads in the city, min. container overflow, min. number of. pickups, max. occupancy (kg per km).

* *Users of the service:* residential and/or commercial? If commercial, which business?

* *Network:* Besides proximity to waterways, what other factors are relevant to select the operational area (e.g., the height of the quay wall)?

* *Infrastructure:* What do the sensors provide exactly? Information on fill levels, weight, etc.?

* *Type of decisions:* Location of containers, routing/rebalancing of vessels, charging of vessels, location/number of depots, move depots, waste-stream (place&pickup, place&leave, pickup&leave, tether?)

* *Data:* Main data needed is the waste generation rate in different areas of the network (level can be decided), possible areas for container locations, size of possible containers, size of possible vessels to be used, features (train/tethering?).

* *Dynamic and stochastic elements:* The containers are dynamically emptied so the routes are dynamic.
Locations of the containers could be also dynamic, Gemeente mentioned that they are looking into dynamic containers in the city.
Stochastic elements are specifically waste generation rates and could also be the time spent in the system while traveling and/or serving the containers.

*Questions*

* How to account for waste separation (different containers, specific fill levels)?
* Besides proximity to waterways, what other factors are relevant to select the operational area (e.g., height quay wall)?
* What data do smart container sensors provide?
* What happens when a container overflows?

## Logistics - Waste collection + waste vessels <a name="waste_floating"></a>

Roboats move filled containers to larger waste vessels/barges, where the waste is unloaded (two layer routing).
In this setting, Roboats do not need to travel large distances to unload containers, which can be immediately cleaned and returned to quay walls.

**Questions**

* What is the size of the waste vessels? Can the access any location (site-dependent)? 
* How long does it take to clean and return a container?
* How many ships and roboats?
* What is the location of the city disposal facilities?
* What is the best route for Roboats and waste vessels?
* What is the improvement over the fixed waste depot setup?

## Logistics - Goods & construction material<a name="logistics"></a>

*Floating warehouses* (FWs) are loaded outside the city and tugged by Roboats to the city center.
Crane vessels unload the cargo at city hubs.
The cargo goes on to the destination (business, construction sites).

**Questions**
* What is the demand distribution?
* Are the city hubs equipped with cranes?
* What is the location of the outside-city warehouse?
* How many FWs are necessary?
* What is the size of a FW?
* What is the optimal FW product assortment?
* How long does it take to load/unload cargo?

## Logistics - Parcels and drones<a name="drones"></a>

Similarly to [truck+drone delivery](https://discovery.rsm.nl/articles/344-the-benefits-of-combining-drones-and-trucks-for-deliveries/), Roboats can tug *floating warehouses* (FW) from where drones pick up parcels.
This setup is the waterway-equivalent to Amazon's drone deployment blimp concept (see below).

[![Amazon Blimp](http://img.youtube.com/vi/BXY3LPx8DGc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY3LPx8DGc "Amazon drone-deploying blimp")

**Questions**
* What is the location of the city hub(s) where FWs are loaded?
* What is the capacity of an FW?
* What is the capacity and autonomy of the drones?
* How frequently Roboats tug FWs to city hubs?
* What is the best assortment of parcels on an FW?
* How to manage the battery usage of Roboats and drones (barges can feature recharging stations too)?
* How to route Roboats and drones?

***

# Mobility-on-demand (MoD)<a name="passenger"></a>

Roboats can be autonomous water taxis or buses, adding to the experience of both tourists and locals.

* *Status quo:* What are the main drawbacks of the current system (e.g., long travel times)?

* *Objective:* min. pickup and in-vehicle delays, min. cost (operation, deployment), min. distance traveled.

* *Users of the service:* Passengers.

* *Network:* We consider the central part of Amsterdam is interesting but needs to be further specified which area/subnetwork to focus on.

* *The infrastructure:* Can the passengers be dropped off and picked up anywhere in the network? What is the subset of possible pickup points? How much does it cost to install a new pickup point? What is the contribution of each new pickup point to the system (install
highest ROI points first)? What are the parameters to choose a node (e.g., increase connectivity, decrease traffic)?

* *Type of decisions:* Location of drop-off/pickup points, routing/rebalancing of vessels, charging of vessels (?)

* *Data:* Main data needed is the demand between different origin destinations at different times of the day (e.g., historical itineraries from OV-chipkaart), possible areas for dropoff/pickup points, vessel features (size, avg. speed), dynamic travel times, boarding delay.

* *Dynamic and stochastic elements:* The routes are dynamically updated based on the demand and the frequency of re-optimization needs to be determined during the research.
Locations of drop-off and pickup points need to be clarified in terms of how restricted we are and whether they can be dynamic as well.
    * Stochastic elements:
        * Demand (where and when it occurs and where is the destination);
        * Travel times within the network.

**Questions**

* In which areas can Roboats compete/complement other modes (see [time comparison](http://senseable.mit.edu/timing-amsterdam/) with bicycling, driving, transit, walking)?
* Is it feasible to include Roboats in a *mobility-as-a-service* (MaaS) framework?

## MoD + Routing touristic tours<a name="tourist"></a>

Roboats could be used as an alternative mode of transport to improve the museum experience in Amsterdam, by combining museum visits and boat tours.

**Questions**
* How many visitors per day? How to measure their movements?
* To what extent Roboats can alleviate on-street traffic?
* Where are the pickup points (jetties, closest quay)?
* Which destinations to include in the route?
* How to create personalized tours?
* How long boats wait at a point before departing (stochastic information)?
* Which points were already visited by each user (predict future destinations)?

## MoD + Transfers <a name="transfer"></a>

Roboats can transfer passengers to one another to improve operational efficiency.
Transfer operations may be carried out:
1. *Over water:* Roboats latch to each other and passengers move.    
1. *At fixed transfer points:* *Roboat A* delivers passengers at a fixed transfer point (jetty, quay) where they will be picked up by *Roboat B*.
1. *At temporary platforms:* Floating platforms are assembled on-demand to facilitate transfers between Roboats.
When individual Roboat units are latched, different combinations of floating platforms can be created.
In their new configuration they form floating pixels and respond as new autonomous organisms.

**Questions**

1. *Transfer over water*   
    * How long does it take to latch Roboats and transfer passengers?
    * Where (i.e., which part of the route) do Roboats realize transfers?
1. *Transfer at fixed points*
    * Where are the transfer points?
    * How many transfer points are necessary?
1. *Transfer at temporary platforms*
    * How many platforms?
    * Where are they located?

## Mooring private boats<a name="mooring"></a>

Roboats could be used to retrieve private boats moored outside the city, relieving the congestion along the canal sides. 

**Questions**
* What is the demand for this service?
* Can Roboats park anywhere?
* Does rebalancing Roboats improve service levels?
* Is there a central Roboat depot?
* Where are the mooring locations?

## Modular Roboats<a name="modular"></a>

Roboats can go to service points where hulls (the boats' technical basis) are outfitted with different top-decks to service heterogenous commodities (people, freight, garbage, etc.).

**Questions**
* How long does it take to change top decks?
* Where are the service points where Roboats are outfitted?
* Could top decks be crowdsourced?
* What is the capacity and top-deck assortment of each service point?
* How to match top-deck assortment with different demand distributions?

## Edge interface<a name="interface"></a>

A key question for the Roboat project is how to interface between the canals and streets of Amsterdam. The solutions should be flexible and adaptive for different contexts. We propose three design solutions for different use cases. The first looks to extend the canal edge as a public space with a series of platforms. The second takes a more conventional route with a dynamic platform attached with a stair. The third allows for flexible docking with an extendable ladder.

## Temporary infrastructure

Roboat units can join together to create temporary bridges, alleviating congestion on Amsterdamâ€™s centuries-old bridges and canal-side streets. As an autonomous system, Roboat can respond in real time to the ebb and flow of rush hour traffic. Individual units can also tessellate to form floating stages and public squares on the canals, enhancing Amsterdamâ€™s strong tradition of water-based events with a 21st-century technology.

## RoundAround<a name="round"></a>

Could a fleet of autonomous boats shorten distances between Amsterdam's newest innovation center and a major tourist attraction while at the same time showcasing cutting-edge science, design, and technology? This is what we propose with roundAround, a dynamic circular bridge composed of Roboats.

## Food delivery<a name="floating"></a>

Roboat units can form floating food markets or become pop-ups stalls that appear on the canalâ€™s edge for Amsterdammers to collect crates of fresh produce.
We imagine this use of autonomous boats could promote healthier food and create new public spaces for Amsterdam.
Roboat activates the canals while tapping into the resources located on the pervasive regional network of waterways.

[<< Back to summary](#summary)


**Drawbacks**

The use cases for food distribution and temporary floating markets for IJburg and the Havenstad area, of which the latter has yet to be developed, show insufficient potential because of Amsterdamâ€™s rich supermarket density. On average, Amsterdammers only have to travel 400 meters to the nearest supermarket for good access to healthy and affordable food [[ref](https://www.ams-institute.org/news/roboat-ahoy-first-prototypes-autonomous-boats-tested-amsterdam/)].
